Playing with the Spotify API, es6/TypeScript, and React.

- All functional components (mostly home-rolled)
- Hooks & Context API (No redux)

## Features so far:

### Client-side authentication via Spotify

- Only Spotify account needed
- Auth is done purely in a user's browser with no server side

### Login to see what Spotify knows about you!

- Profile picture & name
- Top Artists
  - Click on artists for more information like genre tags (these are quite granular which is cool)

    2. medium_term (approximately last 6 months)
    3. short_term (approximately last 4 weeks)

  - Filter(_or prefer_) by a slew of track attributes like acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, mode(major/minor), popularity, speechiness, tempo, time signature, valence(high = more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), low = more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry))
